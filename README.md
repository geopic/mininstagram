# mininstagram

Laravel / Blade / PHP project with user registration and image upload. Users share images with optional captions - like Instagram, but mini! This project is intended to demonstrate my familiarity of Laravel and PHP to recruiters. If you're a dev who wishes to use any of this code then feel free to do so.

Set up with [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#laravel) and a continuation from [Laravel Bootcamp's 'Chirper' project](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/).
